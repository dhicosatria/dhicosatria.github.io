### Cybersecurity • CTF Writeups • Infrastructure & Systems

I am an student also engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity, cloud, system, especially **CTF challenges, digital forensics, system architecture, and system-level analysis**.

This site serves as my personal **knowledge base and portfolio**, where I document what I **learn, build, analyze, and break** through hands-on technical exploration.

---

I believe in learning by:

- analyzing real-world-like problems
- understanding systems from the inside
- documenting knowledge clearly for future reference


Every writeup here reflects my learning process, including mistakes, debugging,
and reasoning, not just final answers.

This site is continuously updated as I learn and explore new topics.
