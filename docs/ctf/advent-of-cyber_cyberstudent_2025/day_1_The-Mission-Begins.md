## **Description**

A series of repeated authentication failures was detected against the **FTP** service. The traffic pattern matched known Krampus Syndicate infrastructure, indicating the beginning of their intrusion attempts. After a sustained burst of password guessing, one request finally succeeded.

Your task is to examine the logs or packet capture, identify which account was **compromised**, and determine the password used during the successful login.

Submit your answer as: **`csd{username_password}`**

*Reminder: Answers are **case sensitive***
